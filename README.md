# Extra options for events

Extra options (or optional extras) might be things like "single room - add $18",
or "student - subtract $33". You can add extra options to an event in the 
'Content > Extras' tab. Click the plus sign to add a new option. Make sure the 
check-boxes are checked for the options you want to provide for this event.

You can choose for an extra to subtract from the total.
